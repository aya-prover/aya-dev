[**Website**](https://www.aya-prover.org) contains:

+ Development blogs which are written for general audience
+ [Installation](https://www.aya-prover.org/guide/install.html)
  instructions (basically telling you what to download in [GitHub Releases])
+ [Tutorial for Haskellers](https://www.aya-prover.org/guide/haskeller-tutorial.html)

Aya is under active development, so please expect bugs, usability or performance issues
(please file issues or create threads in discussions!).

## Showcase

+ Dependent types, including pi-types, sigma types, indexed families, etc.
  You could write a [type-safe interpreter][gadt].
+ De Morgan cubical type theory with generalized path types
  similar to a bounded cubical subtype.
  + Implementation prototype: [Guest0x0].
  + Demonstration of higher inductive types: [3-torus] (three dimensional torus!!).
+ Pattern matching with first-match semantics.
  Checkout the [red-black tree][rbtree] (without deletion yet).
+ Overlapping and order-independent patterns. Very [useful][oop] in theorem proving.
+ A literate programming mode with inline code fragment support.
  We already have a prototype, but we plan to revise it before sharing demos.
+ Binary operators, with precedence specified by a partial ordering
  (instead of a number, such as in Haskell or Agda)
  which is useful for [equation reasoning][assoc].
+ A fairly good termination checker that does not assume predicativity.
  We adapted some code from Agda's implementation to accept
  [more definitions][foetus] (which are rejected by, e.g. Arend).
+ Inference of type checking order. That is to say,
  no syntax for forward-declarations is needed for [mutual recursions][mutual],
  induction-recursion, or induction-induction.
+ See also stdlib candidates [style guide][stdlib-style]. We have a grand plan!

## Use as a library

It's indexed in [mvnrepository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.aya-prover),
and here are some example build configurations:

```xml
<!-- Maven -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.aya-prover</groupId>
    <artifactId>[project name]</artifactId>
    <version>[latest version]</version>
</dependency>
```

```groovy
// Gradle
implementation group: 'org.aya-prover', name: '[project name]', version: '[latest version]'
```

+ `[project name]` specifies the subproject of Aya you want to use, and the options are `pretty`, `base`, `cli`, `parser`, etc.
  + The type checker lives in `base` and `parser`.
  + The generalized pretty printing framework is in `pretty`.
  + The generalized binary operator parser, generalized tree builder, generalized mutable graph,
    and a bunch of other utilities (strings, files, etc.) are in `tools`.
  + The command and argument parsing framework is in `tools-repl`.
    It offers an implementation of ANTLR4-based jline3 parser and relevant facilities.
+ `[latest version]` is what you see on this badge ![maven] .
